Hi there - I'm Sammi! üöµ üè∏ üé∑ üë©‚Äçüíª

I'm currently a trainer on the Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme, teaching public sector analysts, clinicians and managers how to use and apply data science and operational research techniques. I was previously a data analyst, and later data scientist, in a mental health trust in the NHS.

I work with and teach a range of technologies to students on the HSMA programme, specialising in

- discrete event simulation (DES)
- creating and deploying web applications
- geographic visualisation
- location and boundary optimization problems
- tree-based machine learning models
- explainable AI
- reproducible reporting with Quarto


:::

We teach exclusively free and open source software on HSMA - primarily using the Python programming language - and all HSMA training material is released under a non-commercial open source licence, so check out [hsma.co.uk/learn](https://hsma.co.uk/learn) if you'd like to work through our teaching sessions, which include all lecture recordings and coding exercises from the full programme, at your own pace. No prior Python experience is necessary - we start from the very beginning!

I have also turned our course content into openly-available eBooks, with free eBooks available so far on

- Python programming for beginners ([python.hsma.co.uk](https://python.hsma.co.uk))
- discrete event simulation in Python with SimPy ([des.hsma.co.uk](https://des.hsma.co.uk))
- geographic visualisation and optimization in QGIS and Python ([geographic.hsma.co.uk](https://geographic.hsma.co.uk))
- web app development in Streamlit ([webapps.hsma.co.uk](https://webapps.hsma.co.uk))

I'm passionate about making the outputs of the techniques we teach easier for stakeholders to understand. To that end, I'm currently working on the [vidigi](https://github.com/Bergam0t/vidigi) package for visualising patient flow in simulation models or real-world data.

You can find out more about vidigi via my [SW25 poster here](sw25.qmd). Here's an example of it in action with a simulated emergency department![^1]
