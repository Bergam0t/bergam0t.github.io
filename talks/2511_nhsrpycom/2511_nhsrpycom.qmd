#### Template repositories

A lot of NHS organisations have created their own template repositories.

You may wish to use these as inspiration for setting up your own template, or just borrow them!

- NHS Digital rap-package-template: [github.com/NHSDigital/rap-package-template](https://github.com/NHSDigital/rap-package-template)
- NHS England SW Region template: [github.com/nhsengland/SWRegionTemplate](https://github.com/nhsengland/SWRegionTemplate)
- NHS England Repository template: [github.com/nhsengland/nhse-repository-template](https://github.com/nhsengland/nhse-repository-template)
- Birmingham and Solihull ICS template: [github.com/Birmingham-and-Solihull-ICS/BSOLproject](https://github.com/Birmingham-and-Solihull-ICS/BSOLproject)
- Countess of Chester:
    - Python template: [github.com/Countess-of-Chester-Hospital-NHS-FT/Project-Template-Python](https://github.com/Countess-of-Chester-Hospital-NHS-FT/Project-Template-Python)
    - R template: [github.com/Countess-of-Chester-Hospital-NHS-FT/Project-Template-R](https://github.com/Countess-of-Chester-Hospital-NHS-FT/Project-Template-R)

### LICENCEs

#### Creating a licence via the GitHub 'add file' web interface

If you create it via Github, it helps you choose one and make the file!

#### What licence should I use?

- MIT and GPL3 are pretty decent options to start with
- [ChooseALicence](https://choosealicense.com/) helps if you're unsure

### README.md

- A file called README.md in the repository root (i.e. the main folder of your repository), a 'docs' folder or a '.github' folder will be picked up and rendered by GitHub when users open your repository
- Here are some tips from GitHub about writing a readme: [docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
- GitHub readmes use markdown, similar to Quarto/rmarkdown, but with some of its own features and quirks: [docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- It's also possible to draw attention to particular parts of your readme with special sections: [github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925)

#### Bonus - a readme of you (or your organisation)

##### You

- If you create a repository and give it the same name as your GitHub username, then create a README.md file in this repository, this will show up as a readme when people visit your GitHub profile.
- This can be a great way to give visibility to certain projects you are working on or would like people to know about, with more flexibility than the pinned repositories feature.
- As someone who has been involved in recruitment of coders, I think this can really help you to shine. I wouldn't necessarily be looking for it to be creative or pretty - but I'd value knowing which of your projects you think are worth highlighting and what they do.
- Here's an example of mine.
    - I'm Bergam0t on Github.
    - My readme is in this repository: [github.com/Bergam0t/Bergam0t](https://github.com/Bergam0t/Bergam0t)
    - You can see it on my profile: [github.com/Bergam0t](https://github.com/Bergam0t)
    - ![](assets/2025-11-11-14-11-40.png)
- Here are some more details from GitHub on this: [docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/profile-customization/managing-your-profile-readme](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/profile-customization/managing-your-profile-readme)
- There are lots of cool examples out there
    - This is a great one from one of my colleagues: [github.com/amyheather](https://github.com/amyheather)
    - Here's a collection someone created: [github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme)
    - And another collection: [github.com/coderjojo/creative-profile-readme](https://github.com/coderjojo/creative-profile-readme)

##### An organisation (e.g. your trust/ICB/team GitHub)

- For organisations, the repo name and structure is a little different, but the principle is similarThe HSMA organisation is similar
    - it's hsma-programme on GitHub
    - The readme is in this repository: [https://github.com/hsma-programme/.github](https://github.com/hsma-programme/.github)
    - You can see it on our profile: [https://github.com/hsma-programme](https://github.com/hsma-programme)
- Here are some more details from GitHub on this: [https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile)

### Writing Docstrings

- My preferred style is the numpydoc style, which is very human readable and is also supported by a range of documentation creation engines
    - you can see an example numpydoc docstring [here](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html)
- Tools such as Claude.ai, Google Gemini, and ChatGPT are pretty good at
- Extensions for various IDEs exist to
    - e.g. [autoDocstring](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) for Python doctrings in VSCode

### Creating Documentation

- [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/) is a pretty easy documentation package to get started with
- [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is very powerful, but has a bit of a steeper learning curve
- my favourite - and recommendation if you use Quarto in any other capacity - is [quartodoc]()
- see some examples of how I've set it up:
    - example 1: the stlitepack documentation. [_quarto.yml](https://github.com/hsma-tools/stlitepack/blob/main/_quarto.yml), [repository](https://github.com/hsma-tools/stlitepack), [documentation](https://hsma-tools.github.io/stlitepack/stlitepack_docs/)
    - example 2: the vidigi documentation. [_quarto.yml](https://github.com/hsma-tools/vidigi/blob/main/_quarto.yml), [repository](https://github.com/hsma-tools/vidigi), [documentation](https://hsma-tools.github.io/vidigi/vidigi_docs/)


#### Hosting Documentation


#### Hosting your personal site

- Make a repository called `yourusername.github.io`
- Use one of Quarto's [about page templates](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html)
- Make yourself a quick and easy personal site and host for free
    - if you feel like it, you can set up a custom URL.
- Feel free to use my site as a template!
