##### SPC Visual

This custom R-powered PowerBI visual, based off the NHSRplotthedots package, allows SPC charts to be created within PowerBI that automatically adhere to the making data count guidance.

Extensive customisation is available through built-in menus. Multiple output types are possible, including faceted graphs, metric cards, and several summary tables.

##### Health and Social Care Service Use Timelines (Theographs/Pearn Charts) for overlapping data

This custom R-powered PowerBI visual takes a simple, routinely collected dataset of patient history and displays it in a clear format.

Long-term referrals as well as individual interactions with services can be shown, with customisable tooltips, allowing clinicians to get an overview of a patient's history in a quick glance and spot repeated patterns of service interaction. Designed initially for use in mental health services, where clients can have more than a decade of data, thousands of contacts, and systems which display these details as rows of text rather than in a way that allows easy interpretation.

##### Health and Social Care Service Use Timelines (Theographs/Pearn Charts) for non-overlapping data

A second visual is designed specifically for non-overlapping data, such as ward stays.
