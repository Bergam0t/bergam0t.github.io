I was previously a data analyst, and later data scientist, in a mental health trust in the NHS.\nI work with and teach a range of technologies to students on the HSMA programme, specialising in\n\ndiscrete event simulation (DES)\ncreating and deploying web applications\ngeographic visualisation\nlocation and boundary optimization problems\ntree-based machine learning models\nexplainable AI\nreproducible reporting with Quarto\nWe teach exclusively free and open source software on HSMA - primarily using the Python programming language - and all HSMA training material is released under a non-commercial open source licence, so check out hsma.co.uk/learn if you‚Äôd like to work through our teaching sessions, which include all lecture recordings and coding exercises from the full programme, at your own pace. No prior Python experience is necessary - we start from the very beginning!\nI have also turned our course content into openly-available eBooks, with free eBooks available so far on\nI‚Äôm passionate about making the outputs of the techniques we teach easier for stakeholders to understand. To that end, I‚Äôm currently working on the vidigi package for visualising patient flow in simulation models or real-world data.\nYou can find out more about vidigi via my SW25 poster here. Here‚Äôs an example of it in action with a simulated emergency department!1"
