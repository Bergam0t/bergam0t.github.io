    "text": "Discrete Event Simulation is a powerful tool for improving pathways, of which there are a lot in healthcare services.\nOriginally built for introducing people to Discrete Event Simulation at our HSMA open day, this web application is freely available for you to use and adapt under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence.\nIt gradually introduces key concepts relating to discrete event simulation, including sampling from distributions, the role of random seeds, resources, multiple runs, and more.\nUsers are able to adjust a range of parameters and rerun the model.\nA range of animations, built using code that would go on to become the vidigi package, help users to develop their understanding of discrete event simulation as a technique, with a range of other visualisations used to guide their attention to important learning points at each stage.\nWritten using stlite - which brings the power of browser-based python to the Streamlit framework - the tool has been tested with 50+ concurrent users, with the users‚Äô hardware undertaking all calculations. A tradtional server-based approach with Streamlit community cloud could not cope with more than a couple of users at a time before reaching the limits of the free tier - in contrast, by using stlite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDue to the use of browser-based Python, the tool can run slowly on older hardware. It is recommended to be used on a laptop or desktop PC rather than a phone (though a phone will work - slowly - in a pinch!)\n\n\n\n    \n        Open the Playground in a New Tab\n        View the Code\n    \n\nTry it out below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI‚Äôd love to know if you use this as part of your course, a workshop, or in any other way.\nPlease do drop me a message at hi@sammirosser.com or on LinkedIn."

No prior Python experience is necessary - we start from the very beginning!\nI have also turned our course content into openly-available eBooks, with free eBooks available so far on\nI‚Äôm passionate about making the outputs of the techniques we teach easier for stakeholders to understand. To that end, I‚Äôm currently working on the vidigi package for visualising patient flow in simulation models or real-world data.\nYou can find out more about vidigi via my SW25 poster here.
