    "text": "Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a powerful tool for modelling queuing problems, allowing complex questions about pathways and resourcing to be explored before making costly and potentially risky changes to health services.\nHowever, there are barriers to its adoption: dedicated commercial software is prohibitively expensive, while free code-based open-source options are powerful and flexible but can be difficult to get started with and often lack the ability to clearly and engagingly visualise the model’s inner workings for stakeholders.\nThis talk provides a brief introduction to DES before covering a range of efforts that are underway within our team to overcome these problems and make DES an accessible modelling approachfor everyone working in healthcare:\nWhile the work primarily revolves around the SimPy package in Python, several elements have potential to be adapted for use with Python’s ciw package or R’s simmer package.\nWith the first version of the book available, several example models created, and the visualisation package due to be released in late 2024, now is a great time to start exploring the world of pathway simulation!"

    "text": "Discrete Event Simulation is a powerful tool for improving pathways, of which there are a lot in healthcare services.\nOriginally built for introducing people to Discrete Event Simulation at our HSMA open day, this web application is freely available for you to use and adapt under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence.\nIt gradually introduces key concepts relating to discrete event simulation, including sampling from distributions, the role of random seeds, resources, multiple runs, and more.\nUsers are able to adjust a range of parameters and rerun the model.\nA range of animations, built using code that would go on to become the vidigi package, help users to develop their understanding of discrete event simulation as a technique, with a range of other visualisations used to guide their attention to important learning points at each stage.\nWritten using stlite - which brings the power of browser-based python to the Streamlit framework - the tool has been tested with 50+ concurrent users, with the users’ hardware undertaking all calculations. A tradtional server-based approach with Streamlit community cloud could not cope with more than a couple of users at a time before reaching the limits of the free tier - in contrast, by using stlite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDue to the use of browser-based Python, the tool can run slowly on older hardware. It is recommended to be used on a laptop or desktop PC rather than a phone (though a phone will work - slowly - in a pinch!)\n\n\n\n    \n        Open the Playground in a New Tab\n        View the Code\n    \n\nTry it out below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI’d love to know if you use this as part of your course, a workshop, or in any other way.\nPlease do drop me a message at hi@sammirosser.com or on LinkedIn."

I was previously a data analyst, and later data scientist, in a mental health trust in the NHS.\nI work with and teach a range of technologies to students on the HSMA programme, specialising in\n\ndiscrete event simulation (DES)\ncreating and deploying web applications\ngeographic visualisation\nlocation and boundary optimization problems\ntree-based machine learning models\nexplainable AI\nreproducible reporting with Quarto\nWe teach exclusively free and open source software on HSMA - primarily using the Python programming language - and all HSMA training material is released under a non-commercial open source licence, so check out hsma.co.uk/learn if you’d like to work through our teaching sessions, which include all lecture recordings and coding exercises from the full programme, at your own pace. No prior Python experience is necessary - we start from the very beginning!\nI have also turned our course content into openly-available eBooks, with free eBooks available so far on\nI’m passionate about making the outputs of the techniques we teach easier for stakeholders to understand. To that end, I’m currently working on the vidigi package for visualising patient flow in simulation models or real-world data.\nYou can find out more about vidigi via my SW25 poster here. Here’s an example of it in action with a simulated emergency department!1"
