    "text": "Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a powerful tool for modelling queuing problems, allowing complex questions about pathways and resourcing to be explored before making costly and potentially risky changes to health services.\nHowever, there are barriers to its adoption: dedicated commercial software is prohibitively expensive, while free code-based open-source options are powerful and flexible but can be difficult to get started with and often lack the ability to clearly and engagingly visualise the model’s inner workings for stakeholders.\nThis talk provides a brief introduction to DES before covering a range of efforts that are underway within our team to overcome these problems and make DES an accessible modelling approachfor everyone working in healthcare:\n\nbuilding a repository of adaptable models for a variety of common pathways in healthcare;\nwriting a free ebook in Quarto to give people a clear way to learn;\nbuilding interactive tools to teach the underlying concepts to non-technical audiences;\nand creating a simple yet flexible visualisation package to generate animations showing the flow of entities within the simulated system, helping to make the models more understandable.\n\nWhile the work primarily revolves around the SimPy package in Python, several elements have potential to be adapted for use with Python’s ciw package or R’s simmer package.\nWith the first version of the book available, several example models created, and the visualisation package due to be released in late 2024, now is a great time to start exploring the world of pathway simulation!"

A tradtional server-based approach with Streamlit community cloud could not cope with more than a couple of users at a time before reaching the limits of the free tier - in contrast, by using stlite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDue to the use of browser-based Python, the tool can run slowly on older hardware. It is recommended to be used on a laptop or desktop PC rather than a phone (though a phone will work - slowly - in a pinch!)\n\n\n\n    \n        Open the Playground in a New Tab\n        View the Code\n    \n\nTry it out below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI’d love to know if you use this as part of your course, a workshop, or in any other way.\nPlease do drop me a message at hi@sammirosser.com or on LinkedIn."

I wouldn’t necessarily be looking for it to be creative or pretty - but I’d value knowing which of your projects you think are worth highlighting and what they do.\nHere’s an example of mine.\n\nI’m Bergam0t on Github.\nMy readme is in this repository: github.com/Bergam0t/Bergam0t\nYou can see it on my profile: github.com/Bergam0t\n\n\nHere are some more details from GitHub on this: docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/profile-customization/managing-your-profile-readme\nThere are lots of cool examples out there\n\nThis is a great one from one of my colleagues: github.com/amyheather\nAnd another one: github.com/TomMonks\nHere’s a collection someone created: github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme\nAnd another collection: github.com/coderjojo/creative-profile-readme\n\n\n\n\nAn organisation (e.g. your trust/ICB/team GitHub)\n\nFor organisations, the repo name and structure is a little different, but the principle is similarThe HSMA organisation is similar\n\nit’s hsma-programme on GitHub\nThe readme is in this repository: https://github.com/hsma-programme/.github\nYou can see it on our profile: https://github.com/hsma-programme\n\nHere are some more details from GitHub on this: https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting Docstrings\n\nPython\n\nMy preferred style is the numpydoc style, which is very human readable and is also supported by a range of documentation creation engines\n\nyou can see an example numpydoc docstring here\n\nTools such as Claude.ai, Google Gemini, and ChatGPT are pretty good at\nExtensions for various IDEs exist to\n\ne.g. autoDocstring for Python doctrings in VSCode\n\n\n\n\nR\nThis isn’t my area of expertise!\nBut I believe the combo you are looking for is roxygen comments plus the roxygen2 package: r-pkgs.org/man.html\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\nCreating Documentation\n\nPython\n\npdoc is a pretty easy documentation package to get started with\nsphinx is very powerful, but has a bit of a steeper learning curve\nmy favourite - and recommendation if you use Quarto or rmarkdown in any other capacity - is quartodoc\n\nyou can use all of your favourite Quarto extensions\n\nsee some examples of how I’ve set it up:\n\nexample 1: the stlitepack documentation. _quarto.yml, repository, documentation\nexample 2: the vidigi documentation. _quarto.yml, repository, documentation\n\n\n\n\nR\nThis isn’t my area of expertise!\nBut I believe the combo you are looking for is roxygen comments plus the pkgdown package: r-pkgs.org/website.html\n\n\n\nHosting Documentation\nVarious free options exist for hosting your sites.\nI plan to write a slightly fuller walkthrough for this in future! But here are a few jottings to get you started.\n\nGitHub pages\nMy favourite option is GitHub pages. If your work is already hosted on GitHub, this often makes a lot of sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that this is only possible only public repositories and the resulting site will also be publicly accessible (unless you are using GitHub enterprise).\n\n\nIn your repo, go to ‘settings’.\n\nSelect ‘pages’ in the menu on the left.\n\nThe quickest/easiest option is to ‘deploy from a branch’.\n\nI prefer to publish from the /docs folder as this keeps everything neater. This will then look in the relevant folder for a file called index.html, which will become the homepage of your document.\n\nOnce you’ve done this, head over to the settings cog of your repository.\n\nOpening this will give you a space to add a description of your repository, as well as add the link.\n\nTicking the ‘use your GitHub pages site’ option will automatically put a link to the site in the description.\n\nQuarto and GitHub pages\nIf you’re using quarto/quartodoc, to achieve this, in your quarto.yml, you’ll want to add an output-dir to the project section.\ne.g\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\nYou’ll then render your quarto site with the quarto render command and commit the contents of the docs folder.\nYou will also need to commit a blank file called .nojekyll to your repository root. This prevents any post-processing being applied to your quarto site when GitHub pages builds it, which generally causes errors.\n\n\nQuartopub\nAlternatively you can use the quartopub publishing services.\nDetails can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that the site will be publicly visible\n\n\n\n\n\nHosting your personal site\nIf you like, you can also make yourself a portfolio site. This is another great way to showcase work you’ve done, talks you’ve given, etc.\n\nMake a repository called yourusername.github.io\nUse one of Quarto’s about page templates\nFeel free to use my site as a template!\n\nYou’re on the site right now: sammirosser.com\nThe code can be found at github.com/Bergam0t/bergam0t.github.io\nI used Cloudflare for a cheap domain name (&lt;£10 a year) - drop me an email at hi@sammirosser.com if you’d like some tips on setting this up.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto-linting\n\nRuff is a brilliant option for Python linting in VSCode: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff\n\nscroll down to the section ‘settings’ –&gt; ‘Configuring VSCode’ to see how to set it up to lint-on-save. It’s well worth it!\n\nAir is apparently a great option for R in both VSCode and Positron, though I haven’t used it myself: posit-dev.github.io/air/editor-vscode.html\n\nAgain, you’d want to turn on ‘format on save’: posit-dev.github.io/air/editor-vscode.html#editor-vs-code-format-on-save\n\nWhile there is some support for Air in RStudio, you may be better off with the styler package\n\nThere’s some good information on R for the rest of us about using styler via the RStudio command palette (towards the end of the article)\nIt should also be possible to set it to style on save via the R settings (image credit: kevinushey on GitHub: github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/2563) \n\n\n\n\nTests\nDon’t be afraid to start extremely simple and build up your tests over time. One test is better than none!\nAnd even though tests are often talked about in the context of packages, they don’t have to be used in that way. You can use the functions from the testing packages mentioned in other scripts too!\n\nPython\npytest is the most recommended testing framework for Python.\nThere’s a nice introduction to tests in the HSMA DES book here (des.hsma.co.uk/tests.html) - even though it’s in the context of simulation models, it’s a good general overview of the concepts - thanks Amy!\nI’ve also found this free eBook to be really useful: pytest-with-eric.com/\n\n\nR\nIn r, the testthat package is the most popular option.\nThere’s a nice overview of using it in the R packages free eBook by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan: r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html\n\n\n\nIssues + Projects\nWe provide an overview of issues in one of our HSMA presentations: hsma-programme.github.io/h6_march_2025_forum_presentation/#/github-issues\nThere are also some details on projects here: hsma-programme.github.io/h6_march_2025_forum_presentation/#/projects\n\n\nPackages\n\nPython\nFor Python, the best introduction I’ve found is by Professor Tom Monks, in his eBook written for students on his health data science MSc. It’s approachable and thorough, and takes you from creating a local package all the way to publishing it on PyPi. It’s the document I always return to for a new package.\npythonhealthdatascience.com/content/03_mgt/02_packaging/01_python_packages.html\n\n\nR\nThe r packages ebook by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan is a great resource\nI think the welcome page has a great bit of advice:\n\nWriting a package can seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over time. It doesn’t matter if your first version isn’t perfect as long as the next version is better."
