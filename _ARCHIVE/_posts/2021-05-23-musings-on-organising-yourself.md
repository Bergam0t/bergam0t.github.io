One of the hardest things I found when I left university and joined the world of work was keeping track of EVERYTHING. 

So many projects. Little to-dos. Things on my backburner. Priorities. People to get back to. Weekly things. Daily things. 

Aargh!

And so much growth! 


# Keeping track of everything

## Use a to-do program to track anything that isn't regular

The main benefit of having a to-do app, and getting into the habit of using it constantly and consistently, is that it frees up your mental real-estate. You're not using your brain to try and remember the fifty things you need to do - you're using it 

If you've got a report that you've been getting out every Friday for the last year, it probably doesn't need to go on your to-do list (although you certainly can if you ).

But did you tell Bob that you'd pull together some information for him by next Tuesday?

Did you tell Charlie that you'd  

- Trello
- 2do




## Go back to pen and paper: Using a paper diary to plan your day

One of the things I found most useful was taking five minutes at the start of every day to think about what I really NEEDED to achieve in that day. 

Then I'd write it down in a good old-fashioned Â£2 week-to-view diary.

When I completed a task, I'd cross it off.

This also meant that I had a good paper trail for the end of the week, or even the next day. 

Sure, sometimes it became an annoying mess of rewriting yesterdays tasks for today. But that's ok! It helps you spot patterns and trends and over time you will get better at estimating how long something will take.

A good chart to familiarise yourself with is this one (THE urgency, importance chart)


## Organise your inbox

There are all sorts of ideas about 'inbox zero' but this is what I found worked for me.

Only keep emails that require action in your inbox.

Anything and everything else gets filed. 

Set up filters for newsletters and the like so they are instantly rerouted to a folder and don't send you a distracting notification. 

By minimizing the number of distractions, this hopefully means that any attention occupied by a 'ding' is more likely to be worthwhile.

Set aside a few chunks of time a day - maybe just before or just after a meeting, or just after lunch - to look at your inbox and file things away.  

# Review and reflect

## Take five minutes to reflect at the end of every week

Make yourself a spreadsheet or document and scribble down a few key achievements, thoughts and blockers every Friday afternoon. 

Come annual review time, you'll remember the smaller wins that might otherwise have disappeared into the ether.


## Record your wins when they happen

We were encouraged to keep a document with every nice bit of feedback we received, verbal or written. Every 'thanks'. 

Having a bad day? A bad bout of impostor syndrome? Look back at this document.

Again, it's great for annual review time!



## Do an annual review, even if your organisation doesn't

I cannot begin to describe how useful it was, preparing to change career, to have my annual review documents to look back on. Five years of documents that covered my key achievements in the year, my goals, my challenges. 


# Feedback

## Cultivate a feedback culture

This is far easier said than done, but you can start with yourself. 

Feedback - both positive and negative - is essential for getting better.

Some people at my previous workplace set up an anonymous google form and popped the link in their Slack bio. 

## Understand your response to feedback, and the response of others

People can be broadly


# Timing

## Beware decision fatigue

Did you know that we're worse at making decisions in the afternoon?



## Work with the natural rhythms of the week

What works for me personally:

Monday: Gentler admin-style work. Catch up on emails, plan, review your to-do backlog.
Tuesday: Ramp up
Wednesday: A good day for deep, focussed work
Thursday: A decent day for focussed work, but beginning to wind down.
Friday: A great day for learning and reflecting.

## Time blocking

A few times a week, try and set aside a few focussed hours for work. 


Cal Newport's 'Deep Work' is a great read if you want more 



# Learning 

## Keep abreast of thinking in the world of work

### The Atlassian 'Work Life' Newsletter and Blog

The Work Life newsletter would be my #1 recommendation.

Whether you're an individual contributor or a manager, there will be something for you here. 

They focus on teamwork, leadership, productivity, and getting a good work-life balance while making the most of the time you are at work. 

The articles are a nice length and very readable.

### TED's 'Work Life' Podcast

Again, there's a great range of articles
