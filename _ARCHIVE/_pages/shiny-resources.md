This is a collection of resources for R Shiny I collated when investigating how to make more complex Shiny apps as part of my MSc dissertation. 

Head to [this link](https://trello.com/b/Y0YNKH6l/shiny-resources) or view below (though note that clicking on a card will open the board in a new tab). Links can be found under 'attachments' in each card.

If you have any suggestions for resources to include, please get in touch!
